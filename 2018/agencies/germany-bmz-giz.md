After progress in 2016, BMZ-GIZ remains in the good category, taking the last place within this category. 

They have improved its publication frequency, now publishing monthly to the IATI registry. 

BMZ-GIZ is doing very well on all project attributes indicators expect sub-national location. This indicator is not published in IATI and only sometimes made available in other formats. 

They perform well on the joined-up development data component, scoring on all indicators. Contracts and tenders are not provided in an IATI format but are consistently published in other formats. 

GIZ scores above average for the finance and budgets component. They have started publishing project budgets in IATI and are scoring high on commitments, disbursements and expenditures, and disaggregated budgets. The total organisation budget of BMZ-GIZ is made available for at least three years ahead instead of only two years as in 2016. However, no information on capital spend nor project budget documents are being made available. 

Within the organisational and planning component, GIZ scores full points for organisation strategy, procurement policy and audit as these documents are up to date and published in a comparable format. The annual report and country strategies are published to IATI but they do not contain the required information or are not up to date. The allocation policy is not made available in a comparable format. While annual report and the allocation policy can be found on GIZ’s website, country strategies are not provided consistently. 

BMZ-GIZ is one of two organisations within the good category which does not score on any of the indicators of the performance components. While results, evaluations and objectives are sometimes published, pre-project impact appraisals are not being made available at all.
